\section{Optimization Results}

The optimizations listed in this section has been estimated using a $30$ particle Quantum Dot system with a Padé Jastrow Factor.

Profiling the code revealed that, not surprisingly, $~99\%$ of the runtime was spent in the \\\verb+QMC.diffuse_walker+ function for both VMC, DMC and ASGD. Optimizing the code then solely involved optimizing this function. 

The profiling tool of choice was KCacheGrind, aviable at the Ubuntu Software Center. KCacheGrind lists relative time spent in functions graphically in blocks, whose size is proportional to the time spent inside the function, much like standard hard drive listing software does with files and file size.

Prior to the listed optimizations, all other optimizations mentioned in previous sections has been implemented. The reason why they are not explicitly listed is the fact that they were implemented from start, and are considered ``standard optimizations''. Writing a program without them was considered pointless. 

\subsubsection{Storing the Slater Matrix}

This optimization is described in detail in Section \ref{sec:storeSlater}. In addition to storing the slater, the calculation of $\tilde I$ from the Slater inverse updating algorithm in Eq.~(\ref{eq:Itilde}) was pre calculated outside the main loops.

The percentages listed in the following table is the total time spent inside this specific function relative to all other functions. 

\begin{tabular}{ll}
 \verb+Orbitals.phi+ & \\
 \hline\hline
 Relative time spent prior to optimization & 80.88\% \\
 Relative time spent after optimization    & 8.2\% \\
 \hline
 Relative speedup                          & 9.86
\end{tabular}

The speedup is not because of optimizations within the function itself, but rather due to far less calls to the function. If the calculation of $\tilde I$ was done outside the main loops in the first place, the speedup would be far less. 


\subsubsection{Optimized Jastrow Gradient}

The optimization described in this Section is discussed in detail in Section \ref{sec:optJastGrad}.

The percentages listed in the following table is the total time spent inside this specific function relative to all other functions. 

\begin{tabular}{ll}
 \verb+Jastrow.get_grad+ + \verb+Jastrow.calc_dJ+ & \\
 \hline\hline
 Relative time spent prior to optimization & 40\% \\
 Relative time spent after optimization    & 5.24\% \\
 \hline
 Relative speedup                          & 7.63
\end{tabular}

Exploiting the symmetries of the Padé Jastrow Gradient in addition to calculating the new gradient based on the old is in other words extremely efficient. Keep in mind however, that these results are for a high number of particles. For e.g. two particles, this optimization would not matter at all.

\subsubsection{Storing the Orbital Derivatives}

This optimization is covered in detail in Section \ref{sec:storeSlater}. Much like for the Slater matrix, the optimization in this case comes from the fact that the function itself is called fewer times, rather than being optimized.

The percentages listed in the following table is the total time spent inside this specific function relative to all other functions. 


\begin{tabular}{ll}
 \verb+Orbitals.dell_phi+ & \\
 \hline\hline
 Relative time spent prior to optimization & 56.27\% \\
 Relative time spent after optimization    & 7.31\% \\
 \hline
 Relative speedup                          & 7.70
\end{tabular}


\subsubsection{Storing the Quantum Number Independent Terms}

This optimization is covered in detail in Section \ref{sec:optSPWFqnumIndie}. This optimization lowers the number of exponential function calls, and hence optimizes the calculation time of single particle states, its gradients and Laplacians.

The percentages listed in the following table is the total time spent inside this specific function relative to all other functions. 

\begin{tabular}{ll}
 \verb+Jastrow.get_grad+ + \verb+Jastrow.calc_dJ+ & \\
 \hline\hline
 Relative time spent prior to optimization & 5.85\% \\
 Relative time spent after optimization    & 0.13\% \\
 \hline
 Relative speedup                          & 45
\end{tabular}

This result is not surprisingly equal to $15$ quantum numbers (for $30$ particles) times three. One from the orbitals, and two from their gradients. Prior to this optimization, $45$ exponential calls was needed to fill a row in the Slater matrix and the derivative matrix; this has been reduced to one.

\subsubsection{Overall Optimization}

Combining all the optimizations listed in this chapter, the final runtime was reduced to $5\%$ of the original. The final scaling was


\section{Validating the code}

\subsection{Calculation for non-interacting particles}

For non-interacting particles in a Quantum Dot, no Jastrow factor and $\alpha=1$ provides the exact wave function. This serves as a powerful guide, since results can be benchmarked against exact solutions. In the non-interacting case, the minimization should always yield $\alpha=1$.

Let $R$ denote the highest filled \textit{shell}, i.e. the maximum value of $n_x + n_y$, $N_j$ be the number of particles in a given shell ($1\le j\le R$), $\chi$ be the spin levels and $\epsilon_i = i\omega$, where $i=n_x + n_y$, is the single particle energy at shell level $i$. Then the non-interacting energy of a closed shell Quantum Dot is

\begin{align}
 E_0 &= \sum_\chi\sum_{i=1}^R\sum_{j=1}^{N_i} \epsilon_i \\
     &= 2\sum_{i=1}^R N_i i \omega 
\end{align}

Realizing that (not counting spin) $N_i = i$ for a Quantum Dot, we get

\begin{align}
 E_0 &= 2\omega\sum_{i=1}^R i^2 \\
     &= 2\omega \left(\frac{1}{6}R(R+1)(2R + 1)\right) \\
     &= \frac{R}{3}(R + 1)(2R + 1)\omega
\end{align}

which tabulated for the lowest lying shells yields

\begin{center}
 \begin{tabular}{cc|c}
 R & N  & $E_0/\omega$ \\
 \hline
 1 & 2  & 2  \\
 2 & 6  & 10 \\
 3 & 12 & 28 \\
 4 & 20 & 60 \\
 5 & 30 & 110\\
 6 & 42 & 182\\
 \end{tabular}
\end{center}

The first step to validating the code would be to reproduce these exact results. The minimization method should seek an $\alpha$ close to one, where the variational derivative should be zero. In Table \ref{tab:res_valid_qdots}, validation runs for the three lowest shells are run. Figure \ref{fig:ASGD_nonint} shows the ASGD method finding the minima.


\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cc|cccc}
    N     & $\omega$ & $\mathrm{E_{VMC}}$ & $\mathrm{E_{DMC}}$ & $\alpha$ & $E_0$ \\
\hline

          &   1.0    &   28.0   &   28.0   &   1.0    & 28 \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Validation results for Quantum Dots generated using 2000 to 3000 ASGD cycles starting from $\alpha=0.5$. The sampled variance from DMC and VMC is of order $10^{-16}$ (non-zero due to small deviations in $\alpha$ from unity). The last column lists the exact energies. As required we have an exact match (to machine precision). Hard coding $\alpha=1.0$ will yield zero variance.}

The exact energy of $E_0=1$ is reached after approximatly 1000 cycles, where $\alpha$ has converged close to unity. Due to enormous fluctuations, the variational derivative is plotted as an accumulated average, and is in practice dead zero after 1000 cycles. The variational principle described in Section \ref{sec:selectingOptVarPar} is governing the trend of the energy convergence, however, alot of statistical noise is present in the first 1000 cycles due to high variance and few samples.}

Similar validation can be done for atoms, and is listed in Table \ref{tab:res_valid_atoms}. The non-interaction energy is given by the following expression

\begin{equation}
 E_0 = -\frac{N^2}{2}\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{n_i^2}
\end{equation}

    N     & $\mathrm{E_{VMC}}$ & $\mathrm{E_{DMC}}$ & $\alpha$ & $E_0$\\

    4     &  -20.0   &  -20.0   &   1.0  & -20 \\
    10    &  -200.0  &  -200.0  &   1.0  & -200\\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Validation results for Atoms generated in a similar way to the Quantum Dots results in Table \ref{tab:res_valid_qdots}.}
\label{tab:res_valid_atoms}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The DMC method in case of an exact wave function should do nothing. The trial energy should equal the ground state energy through all time steps and zero fluctuations in the number of walkers should occur. This trend is shown for Neon in Fig. \ref{fig:DMC_neon_nonint}.

\begin{figure}
 \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../Graphics/DMC_neon_valid.png}
  \caption{DMC convergence for the Neon result listed in Table \ref{tab:res_valid_atoms}. The trial energy is fixed at the exact ground state energy as expected. The number of walkers are constant, implying a approximatly zero variance.}
  \label{fig:DMC_neon_nonint}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}

A final non-interacting case to run is the case of DMC without the exact wave function. As discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:QMC}, DMC should result in a better estimate of the ground state energy than VMC in case of a trial wave function different from the exact grouns state. A test-case is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:DMC_nonExactWF}.

\begin{figure}
 \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{../Graphics/DMC_notExactWF.png}
  \caption{DMC convergence for a non-interacting two-particle Quantum Dot with $\omega=1$. Calculations are done with $\alpha=0.75$, where the exact wave function is given for $\alpha=1$. Unlike the case with the exact wave function, the trial energy oscillates around the exact value. The final result (with blocking) reveals a DMC energy of $2.00000(2)$, where the original VMC energy was $2.0042(3)$. This illustrates the power of DMC over VMC in the interesting cases with an unknown exact wave function. The calculation were done with $10000$ walkers.}

From figure \ref{fig:OBD_DMC_QDOTS_w1} it is clear that the particle distribution of Quantum Dots follows a clear trend: Odd number of closed shells ($N=2$, 12, 30) are all similar in shape; the $N=2$ case can be viewed as a zoom-in of the $N=12$ top, which in turn can be viewed as a zoom-in of the $N=30$ top. A metaphoric example would be the density ``rising from the ground'' as the number of particles increase. The same trend is clearly visible for the even numbered shells ($N=6$, 20, 42). The density for $N=56$ (not included) further demonstrates this trend.

\subsection{Lowering the frequency}

Viewing the one-body densities for lower values of $\omega$ (Fig. \ref{fig:OBD_DMC_QDOTS_lowering3D}) in light of the corresponding densities for $\omega=1$ (Fig. \ref{fig:OBD_DMC_QDOTS_w1}), it is clear that there is little to no change in the density profile of $\omega=1$ to $\omega=0.28$. This is further verified by $\omega=0.5$ densities (not presented). 

This implies that the oscillator frequency merely scales the extent of the wave function and leaves the general density profile unchanged. However, going below $\omega=0.28$ reveals an interesting scenario where all of a sudden the densities change form. This is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:OBD_collapsed_w001}: At $\omega=0.1$ the changes become visible, yet the density is still comparable with that of higher frequencies. Going further down to $\omega=0.01$, the profile is entirely different, and will not collapse onto high frequency densities.

The ground state density represents the most energy efficient state of the particles given a potential, and it is therefore implied that the sudden change in the density profile at lower frequencies must be induced by a shift in the system's priorities between the different potential sources. In the case of Quantum Dots, these sources are the oscillator well and the Coulomb interaction. The amount of kinetic energy is also of interest.

It is tempting to state that the impact of the oscillator potential goes down proportional to the frequency squared (remember $V(\vec r) = \frac{1}{2}\omega^2r^2$), however, this view is in fact too naive, as the Coulomb interaction and the kinetic energy is dependent of the distribution of particles which in turn is dependent on the oscillator frequency. What is true, however, is that in the limit $\omega\to 0$, the effect of the oscillator potential is gone. 

Imagine an extremely narrow oscillator well: All the particles would favor stacking up in the center, as $r^2$ (oscillator) decrease quicker than $r^{-1}$ (Coulomb) increase. For lower frequencies we have the different situation where the particles would favor being very far apart, since the coefficient $\omega^2$ scaling the oscillator is very small. However, at a certain level, there comes a point where climbing the well further would cause the oscillator energy to increase more than Coulomb decrease. In other words, there is a balance - the oscillator will impact the particles even at very small frequencies. This is illustrated in Fig.

The question then becomes: Why do we get a change in the distribution below $\omega=0.28$ if a balance is always present between the oscillator and Coulomb? The answer is

% The radial one-body densities are collapsed onto each other in Fig. \ref{fig:OBD_pure_collapsed} showing this effect in more detail. From this figure it is apparent that the density profiles of Quantum Dots with frequencies from $\omega=0.28$ and upwards are if fact extremely equal. At lower frequencies, the outer-lying shells gets an increase in particle population, and thus shifts the shape of the wave function as well as the extent.
% 
% The frequency $\omega=0.28$ are used in numerous studies of Quantum Dots \textbf{referer}. The results of this section serve as a demonstration of why this apparently random limit is so widely applied; it is beyond this limit where the well-behaving high-frequency density profile starts to break down, leaving iterating methods struggling to converge. 
% 
% In the previous section it was demonstrated that lowering the frequency gave an increased particle population on outer-lying shells. This is expected since the lower the frequency is set, the lower the energy cost of populating a higher shell becomes.
% 
% Lowering the frequency further, to $\omega=0.01$, interesting turn of events are revealed: The density profile completely changes, hardly resembling figure \ref{fig:OBD_pure_collapsed}. The number of shells increase due to the dominating Coulomb interaction. Moreover, these shells appear equally populated, if not more populated further out. This is the reversed effect than in the high-frequency case.
% 
% Enourmous calculations was perform in order to converge the densities to a satisfactory shape. The 20-particle density is the larges calculation performed with the code to date, clocking in at ~20 000 CPU hours.
% 
% An equally populated shell structure implies that it is not energetically efficient for the electrons to occupy several shells simultaneously, indicating that crystallization becomes the preferred positional state\footnote{Unless at least one particle is frozen in the QMC simulations, the Quantum Dot densities should always be rotationally symmetric. Crystallization in a QMC perspective comes thus not in the form of actual ``crystals'', but rather as a rotated crystallized state.}. This effect is called \textit{Wigner Crystallization}, and is expected for confined electrons where the correlation energy dominates the kinetic energy \textbf{cite wigner}. This effect has strong experimental evidence \textbf{cite wigner experiment}.

 nuclear interaction extremely dominating. One-body densities utterly boring; exponential decay from core.
 
 Interesting still: angular averaged radial one-body density.

 More dispersed = More chemically unstable. 
 
 As expected Krypton is most stable.

 \subsection{Alkaline Earth Metals}
 
 blah blah good approximation with one determinant -> calculations possible. 
 
 More smushed out; missing contribution from higher |m| since the shell is not closed. 
 
 DMC still are able to span out a more correct wave function. This is backed up by experimental data comparisons. 
 
 The densities are similar to their close noble-gas relative, however, the two additional particles creates a disperse probability cloud. The noble gases have more well-defined (sharp) shell structures.
 
 Another interesting fact: VMC distribution and the estimated pure DMC distribution is more different for the alkaline earth metals than for the noble gases. This is expected since M=0 S=0 ground state is major contributions from 3p 2p states.

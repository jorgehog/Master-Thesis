\section{Quantum Dots}

The focus regarding quantum dots has been on studying the distribution of electrons as a function of the level of confinement. In addition, ground state energies are provided and compared to other many-body methods to demonstrate the efficiency and precision of Variational Monte-Carlo (VMC) and Diffusion Monte-Carlo (DMC). In the case of two dimensional quantum dots, there are multiple published results, however, for three dimensions this is not the case. An introduction to quantum dots is given in Section \ref{sec:modelQDots}. 

The double-well quantum dot has not been a focus in this thesis, however, some simple results are provided to demonstrate the flexibility of the code.

\subsection{Ground State Energies}

\subsubsection{Two dimensional quantum dots}

Table \ref{tab:QDotsResultsAll} presents the calculated ground state energies for two-dimensional quantum dots in addition to corresponding results from methods such as Similarity Renormalization Group theory (SRG), Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) and Full Configuration Interaction (FCI). In addition, some previously published DMC results are supplied. The references are listed in the table caption.

In light of the variational nature of DMC and VMC, the results show that DMC provides a more precise estimate for the ground state energy than VMC, both in terms of lower energies and lower errors. The exact energy in the case of two electrons with $\omega=1$ has been calculated in Ref. \cite{taut} and is $E_0 = 3$, which is in excellent agreement with the presented results.

The DMC energies calculated in this thesis has a lower error than those provided in Ref. \cite{MagnusArticle}. This may only be due to the fact that the calculations in this thesis have been run on a super computer. Running smaller simulations on fewer processors results in larger errors. Both the implementations successfully agree with the FCI result for two particles, which strongly indicates that the disagreements in results are a result of systematic errors.    

In the case of two particles, DMC and FCI agree up to five decimals, which leads to the conclusion that DMC indeed is a very precise method. The SRG method is not variational in the sense that it can undershoot the exact energy. The DMC result should thus not be read as less precise in the cases where SRG provides a lower energy estimate. Diffusion Monte-Carlo and SRG are in excellent agreement for a large number of particles compared to FCI and CCSD, which drift away from the DMC results as their basis sizes shrink. 

For high frequencies, the VMC energy is higher than the CCSD energy. The fact that both the methods are variational implies that CCSD performs better than VMC in this frequency range. However, looking at the results the lower frequency range, it is clear that VMC performs better than CCSD. This is due to the fact that CCSD struggles with convergence as the correlations within the system increase, indicated by the decrease in number of shells used to perform the calculations.

The DMC energy is overall less than the CCSD energy, which, due to the variational nature of the methods, implies that DMC performs better than CCSD. The results for $56$ particles are in excellent agreement with each other.

\caption{Ground state energy results for three-dimensional $N$-electron quantum dots with frequency $\omega$. The values in the fifth column is exact calculations taken from Ref. \cite{taut}. The VMC result is as expected always higher than the corresponding DMC result.}
\label{tab:QDotsResults3D}
\end{center}
\end{table}
\setlength{\tabcolsep}{6pt}

The results for three dimensional quantum dots are presented in Table \ref{tab:QDotsResults3D}. Three dimensional quantum dots do not have the same foothold in literature as the two dimensional ones, hence no results are listed except for some exact solutions taken from Ref. \cite{taut}. 

As expected, DMC reproduces the exact results for two particles. Compared to the exact results for two dimensions, which was reproduced with five digit precision, the exact results are reproduced with six decimal precision for three dimensions. This strongly indicates that for two electrons, DMC behaves better for three dimensions than for two. For higher number of particles, however, the errors are of the same order of magnitude as for two dimensions, leading to the conclusion that DMC performs equally good in either dimension for quantum dots. 

\subsection{One-body Densities}

The one-body densities are calculated using the methods described in Section \ref{sec:OBD}.

Figure \ref{fig:OBD_DMC_QDOTS_w1} presents the one-body densities for two-dimensional quantum dots. It is clear that the distribution is following a clear trend: Odd number of closed shells ($N=2$, 12, 30) are all similar in shape. It is almost as if the $N=2$ case is a zoom-in of the $N=12$ top, which in turn is a zoom-in of the $N=30$ top. A physical explanation is that the shapes are conserved due to the fact that they represent energetically favorable configurations. 

The same trend is present for the even numbered shells ($N=6$, 20, 42) as well. The density for $N=56$, which is not included in the figure, further demonstrates this trend. Viewing the distributions as a sequence of images, from the lowest number of particles to the highest, it is apparent that the shape propagates very much like water ripples. It is remarkable how the solutions to the most complex of equations can come in the form of simple patterns found all around nature.

 Adding a third positional dimension changes the shape of the Schrödinger equation, which due to the Coulomb interaction is not separable in Cartesian coordinates. In other words, by going to three dimensions, the general shape of the solutions are expected to change. Nevertheless, by looking at the one-body densities for three dimensions in Figure \ref{fig:OBD_QDOTS3D_highfreq}, it is apparent that the general density profile is unchanged with respect to the number of closed shells. However, by comparing the two dimensional density for $N=20$ electrons from Figure \ref{fig:OBD_DMC_QDOTS_w1} with the three dimensional one for the same number of particles, it is clear that the shape of the densities are not conserved with respect to $N$ alone.

\subsection{Lowering the frequency}


From Figure \ref{fig:OBD_QDOTS3D_lowfreq} it is apparent that lowering the frequency shifts the electrons away from the center of the potential. Moreover, Figure \ref{fig:OBD_DMC_QDOTS_lowering3D} reveals that the outer lying shells become just as populated as the inner lying shells, which means that all of the shells contain the same amount of particles on average.

This behavior is expected since the lower the frequency is set, the lower the energy cost of populating a higher shell becomes. 

An equally populated shell structure implies that it is not energetically efficient for the electrons to occupy several shells simultaneously, indicating that crystallization becomes the preferred positional state\footnote{Unless at least one particle is frozen in the QMC simulations, the Quantum Dot densities should always be rotationally symmetric. Crystallization in a QMC perspective comes thus not in the form of actual ``crystals'', but rather as a rotated crystallized state.}. This effect is called \textit{Wigner Crystallization}, and is expected for confined electrons with a potential energy which dominates the kinetic energy \cite{WignerMolecule}. This effect has strong experimental evidence \cite{WignerCrystal, WignerCrystal2}. 

The fact that the correlation energy dominates the kinetic energy is clear by looking at Figure \ref{fig:E_dist_qdots}. The kinetic energy contribution is almost constant with respect to the frequency, while the Coulomb energy contribution rapidly increases.

Another very interesting result is that the symmetries for the two - and three dimensional closed shells solutions discussed in the previous section are broken at lower frequencies. The radial density for $N=8$ in Figure \ref{fig:OBD_QDOTS3D_lowfreq} does in no way resemble the $N=6$ density in Figure \ref{fig:OBD_DMC_QDOTS_lowering3D}.

  \caption{The relative magnitude of the different energy sources as a function of the frequency $\omega$ (left) together with the magnitude of the sources' energy contributions scaled with the oscillator frequency (right). The plots are supplied with legends to increase the readability. The different energy sources are kinetic (kin), oscillator (osc) and Coulomb (col). It is apparent that the kinetic contribution is constant in both cases and the potential contribution is constant for the relative energies. The values are calculated using two dimensional quantum dots. The number of electrons $N$ are displayed beneath each respective plot.}

In other words, quantum dots fall into a crystallized state at low frequencies. In light of the previous discussion regarding Wigner crystallization, this follows as a consequence of the kinetic energy being dominated by the Coulomb energy. Since the Coulomb energy in turn dominates the oscillator energy (the left-hand side parts of the plots in Figure \ref{fig:E_dist_qdots}), the interesting quantity to study is the kinetic energy as a function of the total potential energy. 

This is closely related to the \textit{virial theorem} from classical mechanics. The quantum mechanical version of the virial theorem was proven by Fock in 1930 \cite{FockVirial} and reads

\begin{equation}
 V(\mathbf{r}) \propto r^\gamma \quad\longrightarrow\quad \langle \OP{T} \rangle = \frac{\gamma}{2} \langle \OP{V} \rangle, \label{eq:virial}
\end{equation}

where $\OP{T}$ and $\OP{V}$ denote the kinetic - and potential energy operators respectively. The important conclusion which can be drawn from this is that a constant slope in the kinetic - vs. potential energy plot implies that the systems behave identically, that is, they follow the same effective potential and thus have similar eigenstates. From Figure \ref{fig:V_dist_qdots} it is apparent that there is a remarkably constant slope for two different regions: High - and low kinetic energy, which by looking at Figure \ref{fig:E_dist_qdots} corresponds to high - and low frequencies. This proves that the system changes characteristics as the frequency changes, which explains the sudden change in the density profiles.

  \caption{The total kinetic energy vs. the total potential energy of two dimensional quantum dots. The number of electrons $N$ are displayed beneath each respective plot. The axes are scaled with a power of $N$ to collapse the data to the same axis span. Once the kinetic energy drops below a certain energy dependent on the number of particles, the slope changes, which in light of the virial theorem from Eq.~(\ref{eq:virial}) indicates that the overall system changes properties. The data is fitted to linear lines with resulting slopes $a$ displayed in the legend. The parameter $r2$ indicates how well the data fits a linear line. An exact fit yields $r2 = 1$.}

\subsection{Simulating a Double-well}

  \caption{A countour plot of the trial wave function for a two particle double-well quantum dot with the wells separated at a distance $R = 2$ in the $x$-direction using $m^\ast = \omega_0 = 1$. See Section \ref{sec:modelQDots} for an introduction to the double well potential. It is apparent that there are one electron located in each well, however, with a slight overlap in the middle region.}

Figure \ref{fig:doubleWell} shows the distribution for a two particle simulation. It is apparent that despite the wells being separated, their local distributions overlap, indicating that the electrons can \textit{tunnel}, that is, they have a non-zero probability of appearing on the other side of the barrier. Comparing the distribution to the potential in Figure \ref{fig:extPotDoubleWell}, it is clear that they match very well.

The DMC result is $\mathrm{E_{DMC}} = 2.3496(1)$, where as the non-interacting energy is $E_0 = 2$ and the single-well energy is $E_0=3.0$. It is expected that the energy lands in between these, as $R=0$ corresponds to the single well and $R\to\infty$ corresponds to the non-interacting case.

\chapter{Results}

The results were produced using atomic units, i.e $\hbar=e=m_e=4\pi\epsilon_0 = 1$, where $m_e$ and $e_0$ is the electron mass and vacuum permittivity respectively. This implies that all listed energies are given in Hartrees, i.e. scaled with $\hbar^2/m_ea_0^2$, and all lengths are given in Bohr radii, i.e. scaled with $a_0=4\pi\epsilon_0\hbar^2/m_e e^2$.

\chapter{Matrix representation of states and operators}

One of the most common ways to represent states and operators, at least in computational quantum mechanics, is using vectors and matrices. It is crucial to note, however, that we are discussing a \textit{representation} of states and operators; the theory itself is general, and independent of whatever convenient choice of representation we make. 

The matrix representation of an operator $\OP{A}$ in necessarily dependent of our choice of basis. To illustrate this we look at the matrix representation of the Hamiltonian. It satisfies the time independent Schr√∂dinger equation

\[
 \OP{H}\ket{\psi_{E_i}} = E_i\ket{\psi_{E_i}}.
\]

Using \textit{spectral decomposition} on $\OP{H}$ we get

\begin{equation}
 \OP{H} = \sum_{k} E_k\ket{\psi_{E_k}}\bra{\psi_{E_k}}, \label{eq:spectralHamiltonian}
\end{equation}

which by definition is diagonal in the energy eigenstates. If we represent these eigenstates by the Cartesian basis we get the following form on the Hamilton matrix by insertion into q.~\ref{eq:spectralHamiltonian}:


\begin{equation}
H = \left( 
\begin{array}{ccccc}
E_0    & 0      & 0      & \cdots & 0      \\
0      & E_1    & 0      &        & \vdots \\
0      & 0      & \ddots &        &        \\
\vdots &        &        &        &        \\
0      & \cdots &        &        & E_N
\end{array} \right)
\end{equation}

However, if we perform a change of basis from $\ket{\psi_{E_i}}$ to an arbitrary complete set of orthogonal states $\ket{\phi_i}$ by using the completeness relation from eq.~\ref{eq:Completeness}, we get the following relation

\begin{eqnarray}
 \OP{H} &=& \sum_{k} E_k\ket{\psi_{E_k}}\bra{\psi_{E_k}}                               \nonumber   \\ 
        &=& \sum_{k}\sum_{i,j} E_k C_{jk}^\ast C_{ik} \ket{\phi_i}\bra{\phi_j}         \nonumber   \\
        &=& \sum_{i,j}\Big[\sum_k E_k C_{jk}^\ast C_{ik}\Big] \ket{\phi_i}\bra{\phi_j} \nonumber   \\
        &=& \sum_{i,j} H_{ij} \ket{\phi_i}\bra{\phi_j},
\end{eqnarray}

which is not diagonal in the new basis. This is usually the starting point when we do physics, since the goal of the computation is to obtain the true eigenstates and eigenvectors of a Hamiltonian. If we choose a basis, we can always set up the matrix and diagonalize it. However, we do not know the energies at the start of the computation, so the expression above it useless for practical purposes.

\chapter{Dirac Notation}

Due to the orthogonal nature of a complete set of eigenfunctions\footnote{Eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator are always an orthogonal set.}, the inner product between two states constructed from them will result in a lot of integrals being zero, one, or eigenvalues for that matter. Writing the integrals in their full form then feels like a waste of space and time. Even specifying e.g. a position basis is obsolete. Abstracting the wave functions from a given parameter space (e.g. $\mathbb{C}^n$) into a \textit{Hilbert space}\footnote{A Hilbert space is an inner product space spanned by the different states. For every state, there exists a complementary state which is the Hermitian conjugate of the original\cite{griffiths}.} is what is called the \textit{Dirac notation}, or the \textit{Bra-ket notation}.

The basic idea is that since the coordinate representation of a wave function is the projection of an abstract state on the position basis through an inner product, we can separate the different pieces of the inner product:

\begin{equation*}
 \psi(\vec r) = \langle r, \psi_j \rangle \equiv \braket{r}{\psi_j} = \bra{r}\times\ket{\psi_j}. 
\end{equation*}


The notation is designed to be simple. The right hand side of the inner product is called a \textit{ket}, while the left hand side is called a \textit{bra}. Combining both of them leaves you with an inner product bracket, hence the names. Let us look at an example where this notation is extremely powerful. Imagine a coupled two-particle spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system in the following state

\begin{eqnarray}
 \ket{\psi} &=& N\Big[\ket{\su\sd} -i\ket{\sd\su}\Big]\\
 \bra{\psi} &=& N\Big[\bra{\su\sd} +i\bra{\sd\su}\Big]
\end{eqnarray} 

Using the fact that both the full two-particle state and the two-level spin states should be orthonormal, we can with this notation calculate the (more or less obvious) normalization factor without explicitly calculating anything.

\begin{eqnarray}
 \braket{\psi}{\psi} &=& N^2\Big[\bra{\su\sd} +i\bra{\sd\su}\Big]\Big[\ket{\su\sd} -i\ket{\sd\su}\Big] \\
 &=& 
\end{eqnarray}




\begin{equation*}
 \langle \psi_i(\vec r,t), \psi_j(\vec r, t) \rangle \equiv \braket{\psi_i}{\psi_j} = \bra{\psi_j}\times\ket{\psi_j}. 
\end{equation*}

In this formalism, we can treat all of the wave function formalism using the ket as a replacement. What we have actually done is to abstract the case from the spesific coordinate representation of $\vec r$.


\noindent
which is a complex conjucation in addition to a transpose\footnote{We often represent states as vectors, however, you can define properties such as transposed, eigenvalues, determinants, trace, etc. without using this spesific representation.}.

The states are equal up to a complex phase\footnote{Any complex phase vanishes when the inner product is calculated.}, and the wave function discussed earlier is nothing but the projection of a key on a position basis

\[
 \psi(\vec r) = \braket{\vec r}{\psi}. 
\]


With this powerful notation at hand, we can easily show properties such as the \textit{completeness relation} of a set. We start by expanding one state $\ket{\phi}$ in a complete set of different states $\ket{\psi_i}$:

\begin{eqnarray*}
 \ket{\phi} &=& \displaystyle\sum_i c_i\ket{\psi_i}\qquad\qquad| \bra{\psi_k}\\
 c_k        &=& \braket{\psi_k}{\phi} \qquad\qquad\quad\,\,\in \mathds{C}\\
\\
\ket{\phi} &=& \displaystyle\sum_i \ket{\psi_i}\braket{\psi_i}{\phi}\\
           &=& \left[\displaystyle\sum_i \ket{\psi_i}\bra{\psi_i}\right]\ket{\phi},
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent 
which yields that

\begin{equation}
 \displaystyle\sum_i \ket{\psi_i}\bra{\psi_i} = \I
 \label{eq:Completeness}
\end{equation}

\noindent
for any complete set of states $\ket{\psi_i}$.

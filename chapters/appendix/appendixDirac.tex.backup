\chapter{Dirac Notation}
\label{app:Dirac}

Calculations involving sums over inner products of orthogonal states are common in Quantum Mechanics. This due to the fact that eigenfunctions of Hermitian operators, which is the kind of operators which represent observables\cite{griffiths}, are necessarily orthogonal\cite{golub1996matrix}. These inner-products will in many cases result in either zero or one, i.e. the \textit{Kronecker-delta} function; explicitly calculating the integrals is unnecessary. 

\textit{Dirac notation} is a notation in which quantum states are represented as abstract components of a \textit{Hilbert space}, i.e. an inner product space. This implies that the inner-product between two states are represented by these states alone, without the integral over a specific basis, which makes derivations a lot cleaner and general in the sense that no specific basis is needed.



\begin{equation*}
 \psi(\vec r) = \langle r, \psi_j \rangle \equiv \braket{r}{\psi_j} = \bra{r}\times\ket{\psi_j}. 
\end{equation*}


The notation is designed to be simple. The right hand side of the inner product is called a \textit{ket}, while the left hand side is called a \textit{bra}. Combining both of them leaves you with an inner product bracket, hence the names. Let us look at an example where this notation is extremely powerful. Imagine a coupled two-particle spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system in the following state

\begin{eqnarray}
 \ket{\psi} &=& N\Big[\ket{\su\sd} -i\ket{\sd\su}\Big]\\
 \bra{\psi} &=& N\Big[\bra{\su\sd} +i\bra{\sd\su}\Big]
\end{eqnarray} 

Using the fact that both the full two-particle state and the two-level spin states should be orthonormal, we can with this notation calculate the normalization factor without explicitly calculating anything.

\begin{eqnarray*}
 \braket{\psi}{\psi} &=& N^2\Big[\bra{\su\sd} +i\bra{\sd\su}\Big]\Big[\ket{\su\sd} -i\ket{\sd\su}\Big] \\
 &=& N^2\Big[\braket{\su\sd}{\su\sd} + i\braket{\sd\su}{\su\sd} - i\braket{\su\sd}{\sd\su} + \braket{\sd\su}{\sd\su}\Big] \\
 &=& N^2\Big[1 + 0 - 0 + 1\Big] \\
 &=& 2N^2
\end{eqnarray*}

This implies as we expected $N=1/\sqrt{2}$. With this powerful notation at hand, we can easily show properties such as the \textit{completeness relation} of a set. We start by expanding one state $\ket{\phi}$ in a complete set of different states $\ket{\psi_i}$:

\begin{eqnarray*}
 \ket{\phi}            &=& \displaystyle\sum_i c_i\ket{\psi_i}\\
 \braket{\psi_k}{\phi} &=& \displaystyle\sum_i c_i\braket{\psi_k}{\psi_i}\\
                       &=& c_k\\
 \ket{\phi}            &=& \displaystyle\sum_i \braket{\psi_i}{\phi}\ket{\psi_i}\\
                       &=& \left[\displaystyle\sum_i \ket{\psi_i}\bra{\psi_i}\right]\ket{\phi},
\end{eqnarray*}

which implies that

\begin{equation}
 \displaystyle\sum_i \ket{\psi_i}\bra{\psi_i} = \I
 \label{eq:Completeness}
\end{equation}

for any complete set of orthonormal states $\ket{\psi_i}$. For a continuous basis like e.g. the position basis we have a a similar relation:

\begin{eqnarray}
 \int |\psi(x)|^2dx    &=& 1 \label{eq:posIdentityFirst} \\
 \int |\psi(x)|^2dx    &=& \int \psi^\ast(x)\psi(x)dx \nonumber \\
                       &=& \int \braket{\psi}{x}\braket{x}{\psi}dx \nonumber \\
                       &=& \bra{\psi}\Big[\int \ket{x}\bra{x}dx\Big]\ket{\psi} \label{eq:posIdentityLast}.
\end{eqnarray}

Combining eq.~\ref{eq:posIdentityFirst} and eq.~\ref{eq:posIdentityLast} with the fact that $\braket{\psi}{\psi} = 1$ yields the identity

\begin{equation}
 \int \ket{x}\bra{x}dx = \I.
 \label{eq:CompletenessCont}
\end{equation}

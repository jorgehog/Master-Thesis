\section*{Introduction}

\subsection{Quantum Mechanics}

Ever since mankind first started asking questions about the mechanisms behind the events of the earth, physics has been in development. The revolution of physics however, came in the language of mathematics. As important as the question ``why does the apple fall'', is the question ``at what speed'' and ``at what time''. The framework containing not only explairnations to general phenomenon, but also the tools needed to calculate properties of special events, are often named some type of mechanics. 

For instance, we have the classical mechanics, explaining conservation of evergy, momentum, etc. It's fortresses are Newton's Equation, Lagrange's equations and so on. Written in the language of mathematics, it is extremely effective at describing the motion of systems like i.e. the pendulum. The behaviour calculated lives up to \textit{our expectations} of the system.

However, as time passed and classical physics became a well known topic, it's flauds arose. The most common of these are the \textit{ultraviolet catastrophe}: The energy in high frequency radioation was simply counter intuitive. If this radiation followed classical electrodynamics, we would all be fried centuries ago. Something was off. Max Planch served the solution: Energy is \textit{quantized}. You do not have infinite energy states in a system. Some are high, some are low, but they are not continiously connected as in classical physics. This time classical physics did not serve us what we expected, but it couldn't be all wrong! It serves perfect solutions to systems like the pendulum mentioned above! It lives up to our expectations at some level.

So what does expectations have to do with anything? And what's this level where we cannot trust it anymore? Let us assume that Newton's equation only holds for expectation values of quantities:


$$ \vec F = m\vec a \Longrightarrow \langle F \rangle =  \langle ma \rangle $$
$$\vec F = -\vec\nabla V\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, m\vec a = \frac{d\vec p}{dt}$$
$$\langle -\vec\nabla V \rangle =  \langle \frac{d\vec p}{dt} \rangle $$

So, whatever more complex mathematical framework lies behind our classical physics, it should obey this relation. It must produce what we expect. ``Changing'' the fundamental theory should not make the pendulum swing any different. We know from experience that it does not! As stated by Ehrenfest in his theorem:
\vspace{0.5cm}
\textit{Expectation values of variables follows classical paths.}

Thinking of it, if one of the gazillion of particles in the pendulum behaves non-classical, it doesn't make a difference. It's neglectable in the bigger picture, since most of them will behave classicly. When you throw an apple, you don't throw one object, you throw millions of atoms.

So, what's the underlying equation which, when taken the expectationvalue of, becomes the equation derived from Newton's second law above? It's the fortress of Quantum Mechanics; \textit{the Schrödinger Equation}:

$$i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi(r, t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\psi(r, t) + V(r)\psi(r, t)$$
